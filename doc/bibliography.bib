@inproceedings{weir1988combinatory,
	Abstract = {Recent results have established that there is a family of languages that is exactly the class of languages generated by three independently developed grammar formalisms: Tree Adjoining Grammars, Head Grammars, and Linear Indexed Grammars. In this paper we show that Combinatory Categorial Grammars also generates the same class of languages. We discuss the structural descriptions produced by Combinatory Categorial Grammars and compare them to those of grammar formalisms in the class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems. We also discuss certain extensions of Combinatory Categorial Grammars and their effect on the weak generative capacity.},

These models are trained and tested on a corpus obtained by translating the Penn Treebank trees into CCG normal-form derivations. According to an evaluation of unlabeled word-word dependencies, our best model achieves a performance of 89.9%, comparable to the figures given by Collins (1999) for a linguistically less expressive grammar. In contrast to Gildea (2001), we find a significant improvement from modeling word-word dependencies.},

@inproceedings{bodirsky2005wellnested,
	Abstract = {There are two major approaches to formal accounts of the syntax of natural language, the proof-theoretic and the model-theoretic approach. Both aim at providing frameworks for answering the question whether a given natural language expression is grammatical. Their methodology, however, is rather different: In a proof-theoretic framework, one tries to set up a system of derivation rules (such as the rules in a context-free grammar) so that each well-formed natural language expression stands in correspondence with a derivation in that system. In contrast, in a model-theoretic framework, one attempts to specify a class of models for natural language expressions and a set of constraints on these models such that an expression is well-formed iff it has a model satisfying all the constraints. The main contribution of this paper is the characterisation of a class of structures that provides a new model-based perspective on Tree Adjoining Grammar (Joshi and Schabes (1997)), a well-known proof-theoretic syntactic framework.},

	Abstract = {There is currently considerable interest among computational linguists in grammatical formalisms with highly restricted generative power. This paper concerns the relationship between the class of string languages generated by several such formalisms, viz. Combinatory Categorial Grammars, Head Grammars, Linear Indexed Grammars and Tree Adjoining Grammars. Each of these formalisms is known to generate a larger class of languages than Context-Free Grammars. The four formalisms under consideration were developed independently and appear superficially to be quite different from one another. The result presented in this paper is that all four of the formalisms under consideration generate exactly the same class of string languages.},

@inproceedings{kuhlmann2007mildly,
	Abstract = {
Dependency-based  representations  of  natural  language  syntax  require  a  fine  balance  between  structural  flexibility  and  computational  complexity.  In  previous  work,  several  constraints  have  been  proposed  to  identify  classes  of  dependency  structures  that  are  well-balanced  in  this  sense;  the  best-known  but  also  most  restrictive  of  these  is  projectivity.  Most  constraints  are  formulated  on  fully  specified  structures,  which  makes  them  hard  to  integrate  into  models  where  structures  are  composed  from  lexical  information.  In  this  paper,  we  show  how  two  empirically  relevant  relaxations  of  projectivity  can  be  lexicalized,  and  how  combining  the  resulting  lexicons  with  a  regular  means  of  syntactic  composition  gives  rise  to  a  hierarchy  of  mildly  context-sensitive  dependency  languages.  Our  results  provide  fundamental  insights  into  the  relation  between  structural  properties  of  dependency  representations  and  notions  of  formal  power.

This  paper  contributes  to  the  formal  theory  of  dependency  grammar.  We  apply  the  classical  concept  of  algebraic  recognizability  to  characterize  regular  sets  of  dependency  structures,  and  show  how  in  this  framework,  two  empirically  relevant  structural  restrictions  on  dependency  analyses  yield  infinite  hierarchies  of  ever  more  expressive  string  languages.

	Abstract = {
In  this  dissertation,  we  show  that  that  both  the  generative  capacity  and  the  parsing  complexity  of  lexicalized  grammar  formalisms  are  systematically  related  to  structural  properties  of  the  dependency  structures  that  these  formalisms  can  induce.  Dependency  structures  model  the  syntactic  dependencies  among  the  words  of  a  sentence.  We  identify  three  empirically  relevant  classes  of  dependency  structures,  and  show  how  they  can  be  characterized  both  in  terms  of  restrictions  on  the  relation  between  dependency  and  word-order  and  within  an  algebraic  framework.  In  the  second  part  of  the  dissertation,  we  develop  natural  notions  of  automata  and  grammars  for  dependency  structures,  show  how  these  yield  infinite  hierarchies  of  ever  more  powerful  dependency  languages,  and  classify  several  grammar  formalisms  with  respect  to  the  languages  in  these  hierarchies  that  they  are  able  to  characterize.  Our  results  provide  fundamental  insights  into  the  relation  between  dependency  structures  and  lexicalized  grammars.
