(for memory mapped access)


1. Block positions

2. Algebras
 - number of algebras
 - for each algebra:
    * algebra name
    * name of algebra class

3. States
 - number of states
 - for each state:
    * state name

4. Signature
 - number of symbols
 - for each symbol:
    * symbol name
    * arity
    * for each algebra: position of homomorphic image
    * position of rule table for this symbol

5. Rule table
 - for each symbol in signature:
    * number of rules for this symbol
    * for each rule (n = arity):
      parent / child 1 / ... / child n (each as index in state table)

6. Homomorphism table
 - for each rule in each homomorphism:
    * term (as string, for now)


    




All strings encoded as length (32 bits) + string (character by
character). TODO: Character encoding?? Is "char" 16 bits?
